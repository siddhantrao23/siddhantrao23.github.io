Hey there!

<img class="me" src="assets/img/cropped.png">

I am Siddhant Rao, a Software Engineer, Distributed Cloud System enthusiast and love optimization, System Architecture and everything Open Source.

Here you can find my <a href="https://siddhantrao23.github.io/blog.html">blog posts</a>, <a href="https://siddhantrao23.github.io/projects.html">projects</a>, <a href="https://siddhantrao23.github.io/diagrams.html">diagrams</a> and anything else I think may be useful. This website was built using a static website generator that I wrote using python that you can find at <a href="https://github.com/siddhantrao23/siddhantrao23.github.io">here</a>.

I also particularly enjoy painting, cycling and creating detailed diagrams. I'm a sucker for a good sunset, cats and otters <3
