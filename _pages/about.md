Hey there!

I am Siddhant Rao, a Software Engineer, Distributed Cloud System enthusiast and love optimization, System Architecture and everything Open Source.

Here you can find my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, <a href="/projects">projects</a>, <a href="/diagrams">diagrams</a> and anything else I think may be useful.

I also particularly enjoy painting, cycling and origami. I'm a sucker for a good sunset, cats and otters <3

For anything else, feel free to <a href="mailto:raosiddhant99@gmail.com">email me</a>!
